# Time management

Although you may be primarily working on 1-2 main research projects/papers, these can have many different aspects:

```{admonition} FIXME Instructions
Choose all that apply.
```

- Reading
- Learning new skills
- Admin
- Programming
- Testing
- Documenting
- Community-building
- Writing
- Speaking engagements
- Networking

And you are also encouraged to take part in:

```{admonition} FIXME Instructions
Choose all that apply.
```

- Teaching
- Mentoring
- Outreach
- Open Source contributions
- Side projects
- Competitions
- Internships

<!--TODO: Cross-reference to opportunities-->

Time management and prioritisation can help you to use your time and energy as wisely as you can.

## Finding time to focus

Some research tasks require longer periods of focus, so it can be helpful to:

```{admonition} FIXME Instructions
Choose all that are helpful for your team.
```

- Block calendar time for time-consuming tasks like writing and analysis. 
- Book {ref}`co-working<co-working>` meetings for planning and working on tasks together.
- Use the {ref}`pomodoro technique<pomodoro>` to break up longer working sessions into more manageable/less unnerving chunks.

(co-working)=
### Co-working

```{admonition} FIXME Instructions
Add links to opportunities to work together for staff.
```

Working together on the same schedule as other people can be very motivating.
This might take the form of away days, working meetings, hackathons/sprints, or academic writing retreats (like [this](https://writingwithpam.wordpress.com/), or [this](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2020/11/09/how-to-run-an-academic-writing-retreat-and-bring-the-campus-back-together/)).
These kinds of events can work equally well in person or [online](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/collaboration/remote-collab/remote-collab-coworking.html), an for working on joint projects or individual ones.

(pomodoro)=
### Pomodoro technique

```{admonition} FIXME Instructions
Recommend your own favourite tools.
```

The [pomodoro technique](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique) is a method for working in sets of 25 minute "tomatoes", with 5 minute breaks in between.
It's especially useful for getting started on something that you aren't looking forward to, since 25 minutes isn't too long to commit to an unpleasant task.
By writing down what you want to do and what you actualy did in each 25 minute block, you gain an understanding of what is achievable, which will help you to plan better over time
You can track this using an online pomodoro tracker like [my tomatoes](https://mytomatoes.com/).

It also works great for online coworking calls using a shared online timer like [this one](https://cuckoo.team/) or [this one](https://marinaratimer.com/), since it allows you to have regular breaks to talk to each other.

## Choosing goals 

```{admonition} FIXME Instructions
Link to official review system.
```

Thinking about career and project goals can be a useful time-management tool as it can help you to prioritise work.
We have an official review system in place to look at these goals every <TIMEFRAME>, but we can also use group meetings or one-to-one sessions to discuss goals and priorities.
  
### SMART goals

All goals should be [SMART](https://clockify.me/blog/productivity/smart-goals/): Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Timed.
They can apply to individual projects or career goals.

For example, you might want to:

- Apply to 3 fellowships by the end of the year. 
- Send 15 emails to advertise your study survey by the end of the month.

## Prioritising work
It's simply not possible to say yes to all requests.
Agree with your supervisor or manager what your priorities are, both from a personal and a group point of view.
This could be a good use of your [one-to-one meetings](../research-environment/one-to-ones) with them.

The following tools can help you decide which to say yes to:

```{admonition} FIXME Instructions
Keep tools/practices that you and your group think are useful, and add your own.
```

- The [Eisenhower matrix](https://www.eisenhower.me/eisenhower-matrix/) is particularly helpful in helping you distinguish between tasks which are important or urgent. It can be useful to decide importance by cross-referencing with your long-term goals/priorities. 
- Writing out all the things that you have been thinking about as a [Mental Inventory](https://bulletjournal.com/blogs/bulletjournalist/mental-inventory) can also help to identify distractions.
- Keeping a [Bullet Journal](https://bulletjournal.com/pages/learn), and [migrating](https://bulletjournal.com/blogs/bulletjournalist/migration) tasks each day, month, or when starting a new journal, can help you to identify tasks that you continue to put off. This may represent a change in your priorities (no longer important to you) or that you need to set aside a specific time to do it.
- Keeping a list of opportunities that you had to say no to can help recognise saying no as an achievement. The list can serve as useful inspiration for applying for funding, or asking for more resource/assistance.
    
## Estimating time needed for work
When planning timescales for the future work, remember to factor in time for:

- Holidays and sick days.
- A post-mortem of the project (which will help you with accurately estimating future projects).

If you are planning the time needed to do a technical piece of work that you haven't done before:

- Get a second opinion from someone who does this kind of work
- Factor in time for learning
