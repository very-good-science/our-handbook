As Bristol Medical School transitions from MB16 to the new MB21 curriculum, it offers a unique opportunity for evaluation and innovation in medical education. This project will be tracking the impact of the expanded 18 week programme in geriatric medicine on short-term and long-term outcomes for Bristol undergraduates. This work is generously supported by funding from The Dunhill Medical Trust.
