# Research Interests

The overarching theme of the research in the Ageing and Movement Research Group is to improve the wellbeing and quality of life of older people. 


Our research group has a key interest in improving the quality of life of people with Parkinson's Disease as well as their caregivers.

- **Fall prevention in Parkinson’s, neurodegenerative disease and ageing** - 

We are seeking to establish whether cognitive enhancement with cholinesterase inhibitors prevents people with Parkinson’s from falling. The £2.1 million NIHR funded CHIEF-PD trial is underway, recruiting 600 people at sites across the UK and builds on the foundational ReSPOND trial that we completed and published in Lancet Neurology in 2016.

- **Improving Parkinson’s monitoring, treatment and care** - 

Recognising that care for older people and those with Parkinson’s is often fragmented and reactive, we are seeking to trial new ways of delivering care with cutting edge treatments and monitoring. The PRIME Parkinson programme is a £10 million programme of research that we are undertaking in collaboration with Prof Bas Bloem and Dr Marten Munneke at Radboud University, Netherlands.


We are also more generally interested in improving the training currently provided for Geriatric Medicine:

- **Transforming Training in Geriatric Medicine**-

We have developed an innovative undergraduate geriatrics curriculum which is delivered via an 18-week clerkship at the University of Bristol. Embedded within this is a mixed-methods programme of research to evaluate and innovate undergraduate teaching in geriatric medicine
