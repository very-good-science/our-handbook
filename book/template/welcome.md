## Welcome to the `<GROUP NAME>` Group Handbook

### What our Group does
`<GROUP NAME>` is working with `<COLLABORATORS AND COMMUNITIES>` to discover answers to the question "`<FOCUS OF RESEARCH>`?". We have a particular interest in `<SUB-AREA OF RESEARCH 1>` and `<SUB-AREA OF RESEARCH 2>`. Check out our [`<CURRENT PROJECTS>`](projects/index) and our [`<RECENT PUBLICATIONS>`](projects/recent-outputs).

### Why do we have a group handbook?

```{admonition} FIXME Instructions
Choose the reasons that matter to your group and add your own.
```

We have a group handbook to:
- Ensure that everyone in the group can find everything they need easily 
- Share resources with others 
- Introduce ourselves to potential collaborators and new group members
- Do our project management Openly 
- Be explicit about our roles and responsibilities
- Foster a culture of healthy working
- Help everyone to feel included in decision making and lab culture (which is why we created this together)
