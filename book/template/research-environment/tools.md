# Tools


## Tools that we use as a team

The following are the minimum set of tools that we ask everyone in the group to be familiar with.

### Messaging

We use email for sharing information with external collaborators, or where we need keep a record of the communication. Email is not guaranteed to be secure and has a limit on attachment size, so when sharing documents we prefer to use SharePoint's sharing feature.

### Online meetings

We use [Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com) for both internal and external calls.

### Documents

We use [Office 365](https://www.office.com) for most of our documents
and store them on our [group SharePoint site](https://www.sharepoint.com), so we all have access to them

- Sharing links can be created to share large files securely with external collaborators, rather than using email
