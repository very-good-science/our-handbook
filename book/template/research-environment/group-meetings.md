# Group meetings

```{admonition} FIXME Instructions
Group meetings (not be confused with [one-to-one](one-to-ones) meetings) can take many forms and serve different purposes.
Generally speaking, they should be some form of regular meeting that all (or most) of your group attends.

Things to consider:

- __Time, frequency and length of the meetings__ - you could have more-frequent shorter meetings in the morning, or less-frequent longer all-day meetings
- __Format and location__ - is the meeting in-person, virtual or hybrid, and what tools will you need to facilitate it?
- __Purpose__ - is it for group members to keep everyone informed of their current work, a place where they can ask for help from others, is it for sharing of knowledge, or just team bonding?

We have provided some examples below, from which you can choose what works best for you.

## Example group meeting 1

Logistics
- Every day at 10:00am
- Stand-up meeting in the office with tea/coffee; remote team members via a video call

Purpose
- Allows us to keep pace with developments in a fast-moving subject area
- Helps us to bond as a team

## Example group meeting 2

Logistics

- Alternates between an in-person meeting (with remote team members via a video call) and a virtual meeting with everyone on a video call
- Attendance strongly recommended

Format
- Group members each prepare one slide for a 2-minute update
- 20-minute slot for one group member to talk about a project in more detail (alternates each time) with 10 minutes for questions
- Other in-depth items can be added to the agenda, which is circulated in advance

Purpose

- Gives everyone an understanding of the wider group activities and allows them to ask questions and learn new things
- Helps us to bond as a team
