# How to use the `Our Handbook` template

Thank you for taking this opportunity to create a considered and healthy research culture with your group.

`Our Handbook` is a [Jupyter Book](http://jupyterbook.org/) template for a research group handbook. 
Group leaders and members edit the book together to create a living document which works for them, by following the steps below. 
`Our Handbook` has a variety of different sections, your group might not use all of them, and each section has a variety of solutions that you can choose from.

## 1. Make your own copy this repo

* Nominate a group memeber to [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks) the repo. (if your group doesn't have a GitHub organisation, perhaps make one and fork to there).
* All other group members fork the orangisation repo 

## 2. Edit the book with your team

### Via web:

* Navigate to your forked repository, in `<book name>/book/template`choose the section of the book you'd like to edit (e.g. adding team-members).
* Click `Edit this file` ðŸ–Š in the top-right submenu and make your changes.
* All changes can be previewed by switching to the `Preview` window.
* Scrawl to the bottom of the page and under `Commit changes` type in a commit message (e.g. "adding team member to `index.md`").
* Check "push to main branch" box.
* Click `Propose changes`.
* To add your changes to the group book, navigate to the homepage of your repository and click "compare & pull request".
* Write a quick description on your changes and click "Create pull request".
* Navigate to "Pull requests" and merge the changes.
* Now see `3. Make your handbook available online`

### Locally:
* Clone the forked repo locally
* Set up an away day, a hack day, or a series of team meetings where you edit the book together - see our suggestions and guidance for [what/how to edit](../contributing) and [how to prepare for and run the sessions](editing-together)!
<!-- TODO: Make a guide to handbook hack days: preparations for organisers, instructions for members, etc, i.e. install VS code, add jupyterbook plugin, etc - and link here  see our [guide to handbook hack days](hack-day)-->

## 3. Make your handbook available online

<!-- TODO: add link below-->
* Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/very-good-science/our-handbook/blob/main/book/guide/how-to-use/put-online.md) to make your handbook available online.
* Make sure that you link to the handbook on your group website, and in any job (including PhD studentship) openings.
* Please tell us if you use this handbook! 

### 4. Keep the book updated

#### 4A. Onboard new team members using the handbook when they join

* Show them around the handbook and the current expectations for group members.
* Show them how to edit the handbook, and ask them to edit themselves in to the team members section (using the instructions for new members page).

#### 4B. Review the book

* Review the book as a team regularly (we suggest once per year). Set aside a session at an away day or a team meeting to do this. This is an opportunity for the team to share new expertise that they've learned in the last year, and to decide as a group to adapt new group-wide policies or processes.
* Review the book with team members individually (we suggest every 6 months for new staff, or once per year for others). This is an opportunity to check that the groups research culture is working for everyone.
