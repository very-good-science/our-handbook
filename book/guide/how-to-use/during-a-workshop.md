# What to do during a workshop

```{note}
This page will guide you through what will happen on the day of your workshop.
The person organising the workshop should complete the steps on the [before a workshop](./before-a-workshop.md) page,
including forking this template to your own GitHub organisation.
```

During a workshop, you can expect to:

- Decide what you're going to work on
- Spend some time working on your tasks#
- Ask facilitators for help at any time!

## Decide what you're going to work on

Discuss in your group and agree what content and sections should be in your finished handbook.

Create issues for each of these, containing suggested tasks.

Decide on rough priorities (e.g. “must-have”, “nice-to-have”, "long-term-goal").

Assign each person a first task.

## Spend some time working on your tasks

Work through the issue assigned to you

Make a fork of your organisation's handbook. 

How to create/edit pages

Make new issues as necessary

(Recommended) use a tool like a pomodoro timer to organise your work and breaks
