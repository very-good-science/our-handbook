# elife Innovation Sprint 2021

Welcome!
The `Our Handbook` project is one of eight projects in the [eLife Innovation Sprint 2021](https://sprint.elifesciences.org/projects2021/) ("Research Group Handbook").
We're starting with an idea and some basic structure, but this event is where the `Our Handbook` project will really come to life.
We're really glad to have you here!

## Goals of the sprint 
At the start of the project we currently have a basic skeleton for a research group handbook, and a few materials for how it might be used.

We have came up with four aims for the sprint:
1. **Complete at least two more sections of the template handbook**. Currently only the [welcome page template](../template/welcome) is complete, but we'd like to have content for at least two more sections. These might be sections that we already have placeholder pages for like ["our team"](../template/our-team/index), or they might be new ideas that the participants come up with e.g. "working on side projects", "getting the most out of one-to-ones", or "writing  preregistration". These might also look like resources!
2. **An example handbook using the template repository**. This will help us to show potential users what the end goal is of the handbook, e.g. "The Jean Golding Institute's Data Scientist's handbook". It will also help us to do our next aim...
3. **Improve instructions for using the template repository**. We have some instructions, but they are missing some information and need testing to ensure they are easy to use.
4. **Improve contribution guidelines for future contributors**. For example, we would like to be able to collect good ideas for resources for the handbook from people who've never used GitHub before, but that have a great resource that they use with their group.

So, if you're not sure where to get started, you might want to pick one of these types of contributions, but there are so many other ways that you could contribute.
For example, perhaps you'd like to make us a logo, improve the look of the website, or add some tests that run using GitHub Actions, or perhaps it's something totally different. 
If you'd like to run an idea past us, you can chat to us either in the eLife slack

We have an [eLife Sprint milestone](https://github.com/very-good-science/our-handbook/issues/26) on GitHub where you can check how we are getting on with our sprint goals.

## Project Management
If you'd like to get a bird's eye view of the activity during the sprint, we have an [eLife Innovation Sprint project board](https://github.com/very-good-science/our-handbook/projects/1) which we will use to keep track of everything going on during the sprint.
We'll use this at the start of each working slot to prioritise work.

## Project leads availability

```{admonition} How to contact us
We will be on Slack and GitHub as much as we can during the sprint.

In the __eLife Sprint Slack__, we have our own channel `#our-handbook`, please do come chat to us about anything and everything there! 
It's the best place for general chatting, and getting help. 

On GitHub, conversations can take place in a few different locations:
- __[Issues](https://github.com/very-good-science/our-handbook/issues)__ are where we talk about what we're planning on doing. There should be an issue for each thing that will be worked on (see [Contribution Guidelines](./contributing)). That issue is the best place to discuss anything related to that.
- __[Pull Requests](https://github.com/very-good-science/our-handbook/pulls)__ are where we talk about work we've done and try to get feedback on them. There should be a Pull Request for each thing that is currently being worked on (see [Contribution Guidelines](./contributing)). 
- __[Discussion Board](https://github.com/very-good-science/our-handbook/discussions)__: this is where you can ask questions, or start a discussion related to the project that isn't related to a particular to-do. Since these discussions are public and connected to the repository, they might help other people later.
```

We'll be available as much as we can during the sprint, the tables below describe when we'll be available.
During our working hours, we'll be available for synchronous working through a co-working call on Zoom. 
I'll post the link to these co-working Zoom rooms in our slack channel.
If you're not available during those hours or you just prefer asynchronous working, then that's great, too.
